  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Individuals at high risk for schizophrenia may
               benefit from early intervention, but few validated risk
               predictors are available. Genetic profiling is one approach to
               risk stratification that has been extensively validated in
               research cohorts. The authors sought to test the utility of this
               approach in clinical settings and to evaluate the broader health
               consequences of high genetic risk for schizophrenia. METHODS:
               The authors used electronic health records for 106,160 patients
               from four health care systems to evaluate the penetrance and
               pleiotropy of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Polygenic risk
               scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia were calculated from summary
               statistics and tested for association with 1,359 disease
               categories, including schizophrenia and psychosis, in
               phenome-wide association studies. Effects were combined through
               meta-analysis across sites. RESULTS: PRSs were robustly
               associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio per standard deviation
               increase in PRS, 1.55; 95\% CI=1.4, 1.7), and patients in the
               highest risk decile of the PRS distribution had up to 4.6-fold
               higher odds of schizophrenia compared with those in the bottom
               decile (95\% CI=2.9, 7.3). PRSs were also positively associated
               with other phenotypes, including anxiety, mood, substance use,
               neurological, and personality disorders, as well as suicidal
               behavior, memory loss, and urinary syndromes; they were
               inversely related to obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The study
               demonstrates that an available measure of genetic risk for
               schizophrenia is robustly associated with schizophrenia in
               health care settings and has pleiotropic effects on related
               psychiatric disorders as well as other medical syndromes. The
               results provide an initial indication of the opportunities and
               limitations that may arise with the future application of PRS
               testing in health care systems.",

              using electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from
              electronic health records to explore the relation between
              antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to
              prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity.
              SETTING: A large New England healthcare system comprising two
              academic medical centres and outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS:
              38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded after
              prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990
              and August 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relation between
              antidepressant dose and QTc interval in linear regression,
              adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding
              variables. For a subset of patients, change in QTc after drug
              dose was also examined. RESULTS: Dose-response association with
              QTc prolongation was identified for citalopram (adjusted beta
              0.10 (SE 0.04), P<0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58 (0.15),
              P<0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11 (0.03), P<0.001),
              but not for other antidepressants examined. An association with
              QTc shortening was identified for bupropion (adjusted beta 0.02
              (0.01) P<0.05). Within-subject paired observations supported the
              QTc prolonging effect of citalopram (10 mg to 20 mg, mean QTc
              increase 7.8 (SE 3.6) ms, adjusted P<0.05; and 20 mg to 40 mg,
              mean QTc increase 10.3 (4.0) ms, adjusted P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
              This study confirmed a modest prolongation of QT interval with
              citalopram, and identified additional antidepressants with
              similar observed risk. Pharmacovigilance studies using electronic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest that calcium and vitamin D
              (CaD) may play a role in the regulation of abdominal fat mass.
              OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of CaD-supplemented
              orange juice (OJ) on weight loss and reduction of visceral
              adipose tissue (VAT) in overweight and obese adults (mean $\pm$
              SD age: 40.0 $\pm$ 12.9 y). DESIGN: Two parallel, double-blind,
              placebo-controlled trials were conducted with either regular or
              reduced-energy (lite) orange juice. For each 16-wk trial, 171
              participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The
              treatment groups consumed three 240-mL glasses of OJ (regular or
              lite) fortified with 350 mg Ca and 100 IU vitamin D per serving,
              and the control groups consumed either unfortified regular or
              lite OJ. Computed tomography scans of VAT and subcutaneous
              adipose tissue were performed by imaging a single cut at the
              lumbar 4 level. RESULTS: After 16 wk, the average weight loss
              (âˆ¼2.45 kg) did not differ significantly between groups. In the
              regular OJ trial, the reduction of VAT was significantly greater
              (P = 0.024) in the CaD group (-12.7 $\pm$ 25.0 cm(2)) than in the
              control group (-1.3 $\pm$ 13.6 cm(2)). In the lite OJ trial, the
              reduction of VAT was significantly greater (P = 0.039) in the CaD
              group (-13.1 $\pm$ 18.4 cm(2)) than in the control group (-6.4
              $\pm$ 17.5 cm(2)) after control for baseline VAT. The effect of
              calcium and vitamin D on VAT remained highly significant when the
              results of the 2 trials were combined (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS:
              The findings suggest that calcium and/or vitamin D
              supplementation contributes to a beneficial reduction of VAT.

              associated with modest weight gain but little is known about
              longer-term effects and differences between individual
              medications in general clinical populations. OBJECTIVE: To
              estimate weight gain associated with specific antidepressants
              over the 12 months following initial prescription in a large and
              diverse clinical population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
              We identified 22,610 adult patients who began receiving a
              medication of interest with available weight data in a large New
              England health care system, including 2 academic medical centers
              and affiliated outpatient primary and specialty care clinics. We
              used electronic health records to extract prescribing data and
              recorded weights for any patient with an index antidepressant
              prescription including amitriptyline hydrochloride, bupropion
              hydrochloride, citalopram hydrobromide, duloxetine hydrochloride,
              escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, mirtazapine,
              nortriptyline hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride,
              venlafaxine hydrochloride, and sertraline hydrochloride. As
              measures of assay sensitivity, additional index prescriptions
              examined included the antiasthma medication albuterol sulfate and
              the antiobesity medications orlistat, phentermine hydrochloride,
              and sibutramine hydrochloride. Mixed-effects models were used to
              estimate rate of weight change over 12 months in comparison with
              the reference antidepressant, citalopram. MAIN OUTCOME AND
              MEASURE: Clinician-recorded weight at 3-month intervals up to 12
              months. RESULTS: Compared with citalopram, in models adjusted for
              sociodemographic and clinical features, significantly decreased
              rate of weight gain was observed among individuals treated with
              bupropion ($\beta$ [SE]: -0.063 [0.027]; P = .02), amitriptyline
              ($\beta$ [SE]: -0.081 [0.025]; P = .001), and nortriptyline
              ($\beta$ [SE]: -0.147 [0.034]; P < .001). As anticipated,
              differences were less pronounced among individuals discontinuing
              treatment prior to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
              Antidepressants differ modestly in their propensity to contribute
              to weight gain. Short-term investigations may be insufficient to
              characterize and differentiate this risk.",

              inconsistent results. Precisely estimating such risk, if any, is
              of great importance in light of the need to balance such risk
              with the benefit of depression and anxiety treatment. We
              developed a method to integrate data from multiple New England
              health systems, matching offspring and maternal health data in
              electronic health records to characterize diagnoses and

              between maternal antidepressant exposure and ASD or ADHD
              liability was examined using logistic regression, adjusting for
              potential sociodemographic and psychiatric confounding variables.
              In new cohorts of 1245 ASD cases and 1701 ADHD cases, along with
              age-, sex- and socioeconomic status matched controls, neither
              disorder was significantly associated with prenatal

              0.97, 95\% confidence interval 0.53-1.69 for ADHD). Pre-pregnancy
              antidepressant exposure significantly increased risk for both
              disorders. These results suggest that prior reports of
              association between prenatal antidepressant exposure and

              false-positive finding, which may arise in part through
              confounding by indication. They further demonstrate the potential

              a health care system of more than 4.6 million patients spanning
              more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to
              identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent
              with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing
              was used to train a diagnostic algorithm with 95\% specificity
              for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded data were used
              to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects
              and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV)
              of EHR-based bipolar disorder and subphenotype diagnoses was
              calculated against diagnoses from direct semistructured
              interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to EHR
              diagnosis. RESULTS: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by
              natural language processing was 0.85. Coded classification based
              on strict filtering achieved a value of 0.79, but classifications
              based on less stringent criteria performed less well. No
              EHR-classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar
              disorder on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most
              subphenotypes, values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based
              classifications were used to accrue 4,500 bipolar disorder cases
              and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
              Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar
              disorder patients and control subjects with high specificity and
              predictive value compared with diagnostic interviews. EHRs

              1,528 outpatients in a New England health care system. METHOD
              Treatment outcomes were classified using a validated machine
              learning tool applied to electronic medical records. Logistic
              regression was used to examine the association between medication
              exposure and treatment outcomes, adjusted for potential
              confounding variables. To further elucidate confounding and
              treatment specificity of the observed effects, data from the
              STAR*D study were reanalyzed. RESULTS NSAID exposure was
              associated with a greater likelihood of depression classified as
              treatment resistant compared with depression classified as
              responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (odds
              ratio=1.55, 95\% CI=1.21-2.00). This association was apparent in
              the NSAIDs-only group but not in those using other agents with
              NSAID-like mechanisms (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and
              salicylates). Inclusion of age, sex, ethnicity, and measures of
              comorbidity and health care utilization in regression models
              indicated confounding; association with outcome was no longer
              significant in fully adjusted models. Reanalysis of STAR*D
              results likewise identified an association in NSAIDs but not
              NSAID-like drugs, with more modest effects persisting after
              adjustment for potential confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS These
              results support an association between NSAID use and poorer
              antidepressant outcomes in major depressive disorder but indicate
              that some of the observed effect may be a result of confounding.",

  abstract = "Importance: Suicide represents the 10th leading cause of death
              across age groups in the United States (12.6 cases per 100 000)
              and remains challenging to predict. While many individuals who
              die by suicide are seen by physicians before their attempt, they
              may not seek psychiatric care. Objective: To determine the extent
              to which incorporating natural language processing of narrative
              discharge notes improves stratification of risk for death by
              suicide after medical or surgical hospital discharge. Design,
              Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective health care use
              study, clinical data were analyzed from individuals with
              discharges from 2 large academic medical centers between January
              1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. Main Outcomes and Measures: The
              primary outcome was suicide as a reported cause of death based on
              Massachusetts Department of Public Health records. Regression
              models for prediction of death by suicide or accidental death
              were compared relying solely on coded clinical data and those
              using natural language processing of hospital discharge notes.
              Results: There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in
              the cohort, including 458 053 unique individuals. Overall,
              all-cause mortality was 18\% during 9 years, and the median
              follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1\%) who died
              by suicide during 2.4 million patient-years of follow-up.
              Positive valence reflected in narrative notes was associated with
              a 30\% reduction in risk for suicide in models adjusted for coded
              sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95\%
              CI, 0.58-0.85; P < .001) and improved model fit ($\chi$22 =
              14.843, P < .001 by log-likelihood test). The C statistic was
              0.741 (95\% CI, 0.738-0.744) for models of suicide with or
              without inclusion of accidental death. Conclusions and Relevance:
              Multiple clinical features available at hospital discharge
              identified a cohort of individuals at substantially increased
              risk for suicide. Greater positive valence expressed in narrative
              discharge summaries was associated with substantially diminished
              risk. Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating these risks
              may assist in identifying high-risk individuals.",

              predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be
              present in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge
              summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a
              psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal
              diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient
              psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we
              trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a
              form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of
              words associated with topics discussed in a document collection.
              The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70\%) and
              testing (30\%) data set, and we trained separate support vector
              machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline
              features plus common individual words and the above plus topics
              identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687 patients with
              inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30
              days. The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to
              psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety,
              trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder
              comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and
              pulmonary disease). By including LDA topics, prediction of
              readmission, as measured by area under receiver-operating
              characteristic curves in the testing data set, was improved from
              baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to baseline+1000 words
              (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics
              derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination
              of individuals at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this
              cohort. Topic modeling and related approaches offer the potential
              to improve prediction using EHRs, if generalizability can be

              those of normal weight. It is not known whether this relative
              natriuretic peptide deficiency is reversible with weight loss. We
              studied 132 obese subjects undergoing weight loss surgery with
              serial measurement of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
              peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations at preoperative, early (1 to 2
              months), and late postoperative (6 months) points. In addition,
              20 subjects also underwent echocardiography at baseline and 6
              months after surgery. Significant weight loss was observed after
              surgery (median body mass index 45.1, 41.0, and 32.9 kg/m(2) for
              the 3 corresponding points, analysis of variance p <0.001). The
              median NT-proBNP levels increased substantially (31.6, 66.9, and
              84.9 pg/ml; p <0.001). The average intrasubject increase in
              NT-proBNP at the 2 postoperative points was 3.4 and 5.0 times the
              preoperative level (p <0.001 for both points vs preoperatively).
              In the multivariate regression models adjusted for clinical
              characteristics and insulin resistance, the strongest predictor
              of the change in NT-proBNP level 6 months after weight loss
              surgery was the change in weight (p = 0.03). Echocardiography

              index of 18\% (p <0.001) and mild improvements in diastolic
              function, with no change in ejection fraction. In conclusion, we
              have demonstrated that weight loss is associated with early and
              sustained increases in NT-proBNP concentrations, despite evidence
              of preserved systolic and improved diastolic function. These

              matched controls. METHODS: ICD-9 and Current Procedural
              Terminology codes were used to obtain an initial data mart of
              potential aneurysm patients from the EMR. NLP was then used to
              train a classification algorithm with .632 bootstrap
              cross-validation used for correction of overfitting bias. The
              classification rule was then applied to the full data mart.
              Additional validation was performed on 300 patients classified as
              having aneurysms. Controls were obtained by matching age, sex,
              race, and healthcare use. RESULTS: We identified 55,675 patients
              of 4.2 million patients with ICD-9 and Current Procedural
              Terminology codes consistent with cerebral aneurysms. Of those,
              16,823 patients had the term aneurysm occur near relevant

              partially heritable, no consistent genetic associations have been
              identified. Large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) play a role
              in other neuropsychiatric diseases, so we assessed their
              association with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS:
              We analyzed data from two genome-wide association studies
              comprising 1263 Caucasian patients with major depressive
              disorder. One was drawn from a large health system by applying
              natural language processing to electronic health records (i2b2
              cohort). The second consisted of a multicenter study of
              sequential antidepressant treatments, Sequenced Treatment
              Alternatives to Relieve Depression. The Birdsuite package was
              used to identify rare deletions and duplications. Individuals
              without symptomatic remission, despite two antidepressant
              treatment trials, were contrasted with those who remitted with a
              first treatment trial. RESULTS: CNV data were derived for 778
              subjects in the i2b2 cohort, including 300 subjects (37\%) with
              TRD, and 485 subjects in Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to
              Relieve Depression cohort, including 152 (31\%) with TRD. CNV
              burden analyses identified modest enrichment of duplications in
              cases (empirical p = .04 for duplications of 100-200 kilobase)
              and a particular deletion region spanning gene PABPC4L (empirical
              p = .02, 6 cases: 0 controls). Pathway analysis suggested
              enrichment of CNVs intersecting genes regulating actin
              cytoskeleton. However, none of these associations survived
              genome-wide correction. CONCLUSIONS: Contribution of rare CNVs to
              TRD appears to be modest, individually or in aggregate. The
              electronic health record-based methodology demonstrated here
              should facilitate collection of larger TRD cohorts necessary to
              further characterize these effects.",

              filtration rate below 60 ml/min. Logistic regression was used to
              build a predictive model in a random two-thirds of the cohort,
              which was tested in the remaining one-third. Risks associated
              with aspects of pharmacotherapy were also examined in the full
              cohort. We identified 1445 adult lithium-treated patients with
              renal insufficiency, matched by risk set sampling 1 : 3 with 4306
              lithium-exposed patients without renal insufficiency. In
              regression models, features associated with risk included older
              age, female sex, history of smoking, history of hypertension,
              overall burden of medical comorbidity, and diagnosis of
              schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (p<0.01 for all
              contrasts). The model yielded an area under the ROC curve
              exceeding 0.81 in an independent testing set, with 74\% of renal
              insufficiency cases among the top two risk quintiles. Use of
              lithium more than once daily, lithium levels greater than 0.6
              mEq/l, and use of first-generation antipsychotics were
              independently associated with risk. These results suggest the
              possibility of stratifying risk for renal failure among
              lithium-treated patients. Once-daily lithium dosing and
              maintaining lower lithium levels where possible may represent
              strategies for reducing risk.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The limitations of the DSM nosology for capturing
              dimensionality and overlap in psychiatric syndromes, and its poor
              correspondence to underlying neurobiology, have been well
              established. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a proposed
              dimensional model of psychopathology, may offer new insights into
              psychiatric illness. For psychiatric clinicians, however, because
              tools for capturing these domains in clinical practice have not
              yet been established, the relevance and means of transition from
              the categorical system of DSM-5 to the dimensional models of RDoC
              remains unclear. The authors explored a method of extracting
              these dimensions from existing electronic health record (EHR)
              notes. METHOD: The authors used information retrieval and natural
              language processing methods to extract estimates of the RDoC
              dimensions in the EHRs of a large health system. They parsed and
              scored EHR documentation for 2,484 admissions covering 2,010
              patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 2011
              and 2013. These domain scores were compared with DSM-IV-based
              ICD-9 codes to assess face validity. As a measure of predictive
              validity, these scores were examined for association with two
              outcomes: length of hospital stay and time to all-cause hospital
              readmission. Together, these analyses were intended to address
              the extent to which RDoC symptom domains might capture clinical
              features already available in narrative notes but not reflected
              in DSM diagnoses. RESULTS: In mixed-effects models, loadings for
              the RDoC cognitive and arousal domains were associated with
              length of hospital stay, while the negative valence and social
              domains were associated with hazard of all-cause hospital
              readmission. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a
              computationally derived tool based on RDoC workgroup reports
              identifies symptom distributions in clinician notes beyond those
              captured by ICD-9 codes, and these domains have significant
              predictive validity. More generally, they point to the
              possibility that clinicians already document RDoC-relevant
              symptoms, albeit not in a quantified form.",

              and hypomagnesemia-induced coagulopathy as a possible underlying
              mechanism. We hypothesized that serum albumin-corrected total
              calcium and magnesium levels are associated with ruptured
              intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: The medical records of 4701
              patients, including 1201 prospective patients, diagnosed at the
              Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital
              between 1990 and 2016 were reviewed and analyzed. One thousand
              two hundred seventy-five patients had available serum calcium,

              Individuals were divided into cases with ruptured aneurysms and
              controls with unruptured aneurysms. Univariable and multivariable
              logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the
              association between serum albumin-corrected total calcium and

              hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia at diagnosis were significantly
              associated with ruptured aneurysms. Impaired hemostasis caused by
              hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia may explain this association.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A major preventable contributor to healthcare costs
              among older individuals is fall-related injury. We sought to
              validate a tool to stratify such risk based on readily available
              clinical data, including projected medication adverse effects,
              using state-wide medical claims data. DESIGN: Sociodemographic
              and clinical features were drawn from health claims paid in the
              state of Massachusetts for individuals aged 35-65 with a hospital
              admission for a period spanning January-December 2012. Previously
              developed logistic regression models of hospital readmission for
              fall-related injury were refit in a testing set including a
              randomly selected 70\% of individuals, and examined in a training
              set comprised of the remaining 30\%. Medications at admission
              were summarised based on reported adverse effect frequencies in
              published medication labelling. SETTING: The Massachusetts health
              system. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 68 764 hospitalised individuals
              aged 35-65 years. PRIMARY MEASURES: Hospital readmission for
              fall-related injury defined by claims code. RESULTS: A total of
              2052 individuals (3.0\%) were hospitalised for fall-related
              injury within 90 days of discharge, and 3391 (4.9\%) within 180
              days. After recalibrating the model in a training data set
              comprised of 48 136 individuals (70\%), model discrimination in
              the remaining 30\% test set yielded an area under the receiver
              operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95\% CI 0.72 to
              0.76). AUCs were similar across age decades (0.71 to 0.78) and
              sex (0.72 male, 0.76 female), and across most common diagnostic
              categories other than psychiatry. For individuals in the highest
              risk quartile, 11.4\% experienced fall within 180 days versus
              1.2\% in the lowest risk quartile; 57.6\% of falls occurred in
              the highest risk quartile. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of
              state-wide claims data demonstrates the feasibility of predicting
              fall-related injury requiring hospitalisation using readily
              available sociodemographic and clinical details. This
              translatable approach to stratification allows for identification

              and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) values on the
              risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are unknown. We aimed
              to investigate the association between anticoagulation therapy,
              elevated INR values, and rupture of intracranial aneurysms.
              Methods- We conducted a case-control study of 4696 patients with
              6403 intracranial aneurysms, including 1198 prospective patients,
              diagnosed at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham
              and Women's Hospital between 1990 and 2016 who were on no
              anticoagulant therapy or on warfarin for anticoagulation.
              Patients were divided into ruptured and nonruptured groups.
              Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were
              performed to evaluate the association of anticoagulation therapy,
              INR values, and presentation with a ruptured intracranial
              aneurysm, taking into account the interaction between
              anticoagulant use and INR. Inverse probability weighting using
              propensity scores was used to minimize differences in baseline
              demographics characteristics. The marginal effects of
              anticoagulant use on rupture risk stratified by INR values were
              calculated. Results- In unweighted and weighted multivariable
              analyses, elevated INR values were significantly associated with
              rupture status among patients who were not anticoagulated
              (unweighted odds ratio, 22.78; 95\% CI, 10.85-47.81 and weighted
              odds ratio, 28.16; 95\% CI, 12.44-63.77). In anticoagulated
              patients, warfarin use interacts significantly with INR when INR
              $\geq$1.2 by decreasing the effects of INR on rupture risk.
              Conclusions- INR elevation is associated with intracranial
              aneurysm rupture, but the effects may be moderated by warfarin.
              INR values should, therefore, be taken into consideration when
              counseling patients with intracranial aneurysms.",

              cohorts of European ancestry (EA) and African ancestry (AA).
              METHODS AND RESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred and fifteen
              participants of EA and 366 of AA in the MGH CAMP study
              (Cardiology and Metabolic Patient) were genotyped on a
              genome-wide array and imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference
              panel. An additional 820 EA and 57 AA participants in the
              Partners Biobank were genotyped and used for validation. PGS were
              created for each individual using effect estimates from
              association tests with QT interval obtained from prior
              genome-wide association studies, with variants selected based
              from multiple significance thresholds in the original study. In
              regression models, clinical variables explained $\approx$9\% to
              10\% of total variation in resting QTc in EA individuals and
              $\approx$12\% to 18\% in AA individuals. The PGS significantly
              increased variation explained at most significance thresholds

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested a
              protective effect of diabetes mellitus on aneurysmal subarachnoid
              hemorrhage risk. However, reports are inconsistent, and objective
              measures of hyperglycemia in these studies are lacking. Our aim
              was to investigate the association between aneurysmal
              subarachnoid hemorrhage and antihyperglycemic agent use and
              glycated hemoglobin levels. METHODS: The medical records of 4701
              patients with 6411 intracranial aneurysms, including 1201
              prospective patients, diagnosed at the Massachusetts General
              Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1990 and 2016
              were reviewed and analyzed. Patients were separated into ruptured
              and nonruptured groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic
              regression analyses were performed to determine the association
              between aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and antihyperglycemic
              agents and glycated hemoglobin levels. Propensity score weighting
              was used to account for selection bias. RESULTS: In both
              unweighted and weighted multivariate analysis, antihyperglycemic
              agent use was inversely and significantly associated with
              ruptured aneurysms (unweighted odds ratio, 0.58; 95\% confidence
              interval, 0.39-0.87; weighted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% confidence
              interval, 0.34-0.96). In contrast, glycated hemoglobin levels
              were not significantly associated with rupture status.
              CONCLUSIONS: Antihyperglycemic agent use rather than
              hyperglycemia is associated with decreased risk of aneurysmal
              subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting a possible protective effect
              of glucose-lowering agents in the pathogenesis of aneurysm
              rupture.",

              unreliable and fail to capture the relationship between related
              diagnoses. We developed an efficient means of conducting
              genome-wide association studies using combinations of diagnostic
              codes from electronic health records (EHR) for 10845 participants

              Specifically, we applied latent Dirichilet allocation to fit 50

              genome-wide common-variant association for each topic. In

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records linked with biorepositories
              are a powerful platform for translational studies. A major
              bottleneck exists in the ability to phenotype patients accurately
              and efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop an
              automated high-throughput phenotyping method integrating
              International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and
              narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP).
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a mapping method for
              automatically identifying relevant ICD and NLP concepts for a
              specific phenotype leveraging the Unified Medical Language
              System. Along with health care utilization, aggregated ICD and
              NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of latent
              mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP)
              algorithm yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each
              patient and a threshold for classifying participants with
              phenotype yes/no. The algorithm was validated using labeled data
              for 16 phenotypes from a biorepository and further tested in an
              independent cohort phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for
              2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations.
              RESULTS: The MAP algorithm achieved higher or similar AUC and
              F-scores compared to the ICD code across all 16 phenotypes. The
              features assembled via the automated approach had comparable
              accuracy to those assembled via manual curation (AUCMAP 0.943,
              AUCmanual 0.941). The PheWAS results suggest that the MAP
              approach detected previously validated associations with higher
              power when compared to the standard PheWAS method based on ICD
              codes. CONCLUSION: The MAP approach increased the accuracy of
              phenotype definition while maintaining scalability, thereby
              facilitating use in studies requiring large-scale phenotyping,
              such as PheWAS.",

              characterize the prevalence of financial considerations
              documented in narrative clinical records of primary care
              encounters and their association with patient-level features.
              Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study applied
              natural language processing to narrative clinical notes obtained
              from electronic health records for adult primary care visits.
              Participants included patients aged 18 years and older with at
              least 1 primary care visit for an annual preventive examination
              at outpatient clinics at a US academic health system between
              January 2, 2008, and July 30, 2013. Data were analyzed in March
              2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of financial content
              documented in narrative clinical notes. Results: The data set
              included 222 457 primary care visits for 46 244 individuals aged
              18 years and older; 30 556 patients (60.1\%) were female, 27 869
              patients (60.3\%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 51.3
              (17.7) years. In total, 6058 patients (13.1\%) had at least 1
              narrative clinical note indicating a financial conversation with
              their physician. In fully adjusted regression models, the odds of

              considerations were more likely to be noted in annual preventive
              examinations than previously observed in intensive care unit
              admissions, but still infrequently. Associations with particular

              Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital

               design to compare associations between incidence of
               vascular/bleeding events and the relative affinity (low,
               moderate or high) of the antidepressant for the serotonin

               MDD and monotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake
               inhibitor, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or other
               new-generation antidepressant were identified from among 3.1
               million patients in a New England healthcare system. PRIMARY AND
               SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of bleeding or other vascular
               complications, including acute liver failure, acute renal
               failure, asthma, breast cancer and hip fractures. RESULTS: 601
               GI bleeds were observed in the 21 462 subjects in the
               high-affinity group versus 333 among the 14 927 subjects in the
               lower affinity group (adjusted RR: 1.17, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.34).
               Similarly, 776 strokes were observed in the high-affinity group
               versus 434 in the lower affinity treatment group (adjusted RR:
               1.18, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.32). No significant association with

               liver failure, acute renal failure, asthma, breast cancer and

               antidepressants with high affinity for the serotonin transporter
               may confer modestly elevated risk for GI and other bleeding
               complications. While multiple methodologic limitations must be

               ability to identify the strongest causal common variants in
               complex human diseases. However, to date, the massive data
               generated from GWAS have not been maximally explored to identify
               true associations that fail to meet the stringent level of
               association required to achieve genome-wide significance.
               Genetics of gene expression (GGE) studies have shown promise
               towards identifying DNA variations associated with disease and
               providing a path to functionally characterize findings from
               GWAS. Here, we present the first empiric study to systematically
               characterize the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms
               associated with expression (eSNPs) in liver, subcutaneous fat,
               and omental fat tissues, demonstrating these eSNPs are
               significantly more enriched for SNPs that associate with type 2
               diabetes (T2D) in three large-scale GWAS than a matched set of
               randomly selected SNPs. This enrichment for T2D association
               increases as we restrict to eSNPs that correspond to genes
               comprising gene networks constructed from adipose gene
               expression data isolated from a mouse population segregating a
               T2D phenotype. Finally, by restricting to eSNPs corresponding to
               genes comprising an adipose subnetwork strongly predicted as
               causal for T2D, we dramatically increased the enrichment for
               SNPs associated with T2D and were able to identify a
               functionally related set of diabetes susceptibility genes. We
               identified and validated malic enzyme 1 (Me1) as a key regulator
               of this T2D subnetwork in mouse and provided support for the
               association of this gene to T2D in humans. This integration of
               eSNPs and networks provides a novel approach to identify disease
               susceptibility networks rather than the single SNPs or genes
               traditionally identified through GWAS, thereby extracting
               additional value from the wealth of data currently being

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The prescription use of the stimulants
               methylphenidate and amphetamine for the treatment of attention
               deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasing. In
               2007, the Food and Drug Administration mandated changes to drug
               labels for stimulants on the basis of findings of new-onset
               psychosis. Whether the risk of psychosis in adolescents and
               young adults with ADHD differs among various stimulants has not
               been extensively studied. METHODS: We used data from two
               commercial insurance claims databases to assess patients 13 to
               25 years of age who had received a diagnosis of ADHD and who
               started taking methylphenidate or amphetamine between January 1,
               2004, and September 30, 2015. The outcome was a new diagnosis of
               psychosis for which an antipsychotic medication was prescribed
               during the first 60 days after the date of the onset of
               psychosis. To estimate hazard ratios for psychosis, we used
               propensity scores to match patients who received methylphenidate
               with patients who received amphetamine in each database,
               compared the incidence of psychosis between the two stimulant
               groups, and then pooled the results across the two databases.
               RESULTS: We assessed 337,919 adolescents and young adults who
               received a prescription for a stimulant for ADHD. The study
               population consisted of 221,846 patients with 143,286
               person-years of follow up; 110,923 patients taking
               methylphenidate were matched with 110,923 patients taking
               amphetamines. There were 343 episodes of psychosis (with an
               episode defined as a new diagnosis code for psychosis and a
               prescription for an antipsychotic medication) in the matched
               populations (2.4 per 1000 person-years): 106 episodes (0.10\%)
               in the methylphenidate group and 237 episodes (0.21\%) in the
               amphetamine group (hazard ratio with amphetamine use, 1.65; 95\%
               confidence interval, 1.31 to 2.09). CONCLUSIONS: Among
               adolescents and young adults with ADHD who were receiving
               prescription stimulants, new-onset psychosis occurred in
               approximately 1 in 660 patients. Amphetamine use was associated
               with a greater risk of psychosis than methylphenidate. (Funded

               increased the demand for efficient, accurate, and robust
               approaches for phenotyping millions of patients. Challenges to
               phenotyping with EMR data include variation in the accuracy of

               itself can be executed in 1-2 d if all data are available;
               however, the timing is largely dependent on the chart review
               stage, which typically requires at least 2 weeks. The final
               products of PheCAP include a phenotype algorithm, the

               categorically, but the extent to which such dimensional models
               correspond to biology is unknown. METHODS: We applied a newly
               developed natural language processing method to extract five
               symptom dimensions based on the National Institute of Mental
               Health Research Domain Criteria definitions from narrative
               hospital discharge notes in a large biobank. We conducted a

               were associated with each of these dimensions as quantitative
               traits. RESULTS: Among 4687 individuals, loci in three of five
               domains exceeded a genome-wide threshold for statistical
               significance. These included a locus spanning the neocortical

               confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.80) was significantly associated
               with decreased risk of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. There
               was a significant inverse dose-response relationship between
               aspirin dose and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR 0.65,
               95\% CI 0.53-0.81). In contrast, there was a significant
               association between aspirin use and increased risk of rerupture
               before treatment (OR 8.15, 95\% CI 2.22-30.0). CONCLUSIONS: In
               this large case-control study, aspirin therapy at diagnosis was
               associated with a significantly decreased risk of subarachnoid
               hemorrhage, with an inverse dose-response relationship among
               aspirin users. However, once rupture has occurred, aspirin is
               associated with an increased risk of rerupture before treatment.",

               goal was to investigate the association between heroin and
               cocaine use and the rupture of saccular non-mycotic aneurysms.
               The medical records of 4701 patients with 6411 intracranial
               aneurysms, including 1201 prospective patients, diagnosed at the
               Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital
               between 1990 and 2016 were reviewed and analyzed. Patients were
               separated into ruptured and non-ruptured groups. Univariable and

               determine the association between heroin, cocaine, and methadone
               use and the presence of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. In

              genomic, monitoring, and personal device data, it has yet to be
              fully integrated into clinical care. Methods: We identify three
              reasons for the lack of integration. The first is that ``Big
              Data'' is poorly managed by most Electronic Medical Record
              Systems (EMRS). The data is mostly available on ``cloud-native''
              platforms that are outside the scope of most EMRs, and even
              checking if such data is available on a patient often must be
              done outside the EMRS. The second reason is that extracting
              features from the Big Data that are relevant to healthcare often
              requires complex machine learning algorithms, such as determining
              if a genomic variant is protein-altering. The third reason is
              that applications that present Big Data need to be modified
              constantly to reflect the current state of knowledge, such as
              instructing when to order a new set of genomic tests. In some
              cases, applications need to be updated nightly. Results: A new
              architecture for EMRS is evolving which could unite Big Data,
              machine learning, and clinical care through a microservice-based
              architecture which can host applications focused on quite
              specific aspects of clinical care, such as managing cancer
              immunotherapy. Conclusion: Informatics innovation, medical
              research, and clinical care go hand in hand as we look to infuse
              science-based practice into healthcare. Innovative methods will
              lead to a new ecosystem of applications (Apps) interacting with
              healthcare providers to fulfill a promise that is still to be

               intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture, the exact relationship
               between IA rupture and smoking intensity and duration, as well
               as duration of smoking cessation, remains unknown. METHODS: In
               this case-control study, we analyzed 4,701 patients with 6,411
               IAs diagnosed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and
               Massachusetts General Hospital between 1990 and 2016. We divided
               individuals into patients with ruptured aneurysms and controls
               with unruptured aneurysms. We performed univariable and
               multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the
               association between smoking status and ruptured IAs at
               presentation. In a subgroup analysis among former and current
               smokers, we assessed the association between ruptured aneurysms
               and number of packs per day, duration of smoking, and duration
               since smoking cessation. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis,
               current (odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI]
               1.89-2.59) and former smoking status (OR 1.56, 95\% CI
               1.31-1.86) were associated with rupture status at presentation
               compared with never smokers. In a subgroup analysis among
               current and former smokers, years smoked (OR 1.02, 95\% CI
               1.01-1.03) and packs per day (OR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.25-1.70) were
               significantly associated with ruptured aneurysms at
               presentation, whereas duration since cessation among former
               smokers was not significant (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.99-1.02).
               CONCLUSIONS: Current cigarette smoking, smoking intensity, and
               smoking duration are significantly associated with ruptured IAs
               at presentation. However, the significantly increased risk
               persists after smoking cessation, and smoking cessation does not
               confer a reduced risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
               beyond that of reducing the cumulative dose.",

               longitudinal historical data, commonly available in electronic
               health record (EHR) systems, can be used to predict patients'
               future risk of suicidal behavior. METHOD: Bayesian models were
               developed using a retrospective cohort approach. EHR data from a
               large health care database spanning 15 years (1998-2012) of
               inpatient and outpatient visits were used to predict future
               documented suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide attempt or death).
               Patients with three or more visits (N=1,728,549) were included.
               ICD-9-based case definition for suicidal behavior was derived by
               expert clinician consensus review of 2,700 narrative EHR notes
               (from 520 patients), supplemented by state death certificates.
               Model performance was evaluated retrospectively using an
               independent testing set. RESULTS: Among the study population,
               1.2\% (N=20,246) met the case definition for suicidal behavior.
               The model achieved sensitive (33\%-45\% sensitivity), specific
               (90\%-95\% specificity), and early (3-4 years in advance on
               average) prediction of patients' future suicidal behavior. The
               strongest predictors identified by the model included both
               well-known (e.g., substance abuse and psychiatric disorders) and
               less conventional (e.g., certain injuries and chronic
               conditions) risk factors, indicating that a data-driven approach
               can yield more comprehensive risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS:
               Longitudinal EHR data, commonly available in clinical settings,
               can be useful for predicting future risk of suicidal behavior.
               This modeling approach could serve as an early warning system to
               help clinicians identify high-risk patients for further
               screening. By analyzing the full phenotypic breadth of the EHR,
               computerized risk screening approaches may enhance prediction
               beyond what is feasible for individual clinicians.",

               Observational cohort study among 2859 women treated for
               depression during the 2 years prior to pregnancy. The primary
               exposure was any antidepressant treatment during pregnancy.

               application of depression screening tools in stratifying risk
               has not been defined. The current study examines new approaches
               to improve the ability of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
               Scale (EPDS) to stratify risk for postpartum depression,
               including alternate cut points, use of a continuous measure, and
               incorporation of other putative risk factors. METHODS: An
               observational cohort study of 4939 women screened both
               antepartum and postpartum with a negative EPDS screen
               antepartum(i.e. EPDS95\%) at all antepartum EPDS cut-off values

               to 0.73) when the antepartum EPDS was combined with a prior
               history of major depressive disorder before pregnancy.
               LIMITATIONS: An inability to assess EPDS subscales and a
               relatively low prevalence of depression in this cohort.
               CONCLUSIONS: Though an antepartum EPDS cut-off score <5 yielded

               a potentially modifiable risk factor for treatment nonresponse.
               We used a novel approach based on discarded blood samples from
               routine clinical blood draws to assess treatment nonadherence in
               a general clinical population. METHOD: Individuals diagnosed
               with or without major depressive disorder (using ICD-9) and
               prescribed sertraline, citalopram, bupropion, or venlafaxine in
               January 2014 were identified by querying the electronic health
               record of 2 academic medical centers. Discarded blood samples
               from routine blood draws for 109 individuals within 14-90 days
               of treatment initiation were anonymized and then assessed for
               detectable serum antidepressant levels. RESULTS: Overall, 17\%
               of samples lacked detectable levels of the index antidepressant.
               Individuals with public versus private insurance were more
               likely to have undetectable antidepressant levels ($\chi$(2)1 =
               5.07, P = .02) as were those receiving shorter-term (< 90 days)
               prescriptions ($\chi$(2)1 = 4.03, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: In
               general, electronic prescribing data provided a reasonable proxy
               for actual antidepressant use. Additionally, up to 1 in 5
               individuals prescribed an antidepressant may not be adherent,

               METHODS: This was an observational cohort study conducted among
               women who completed Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
               screening and delivered at 20 weeks of gestation or greater. The
               primary outcomes were preterm birth and an SGA neonate at birth
               (less than 10th percentile for gestational age); the primary
               predictor was an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale antepartum
               score of 10 or greater, indicating symptoms of depression.
               Logistic regression models were used with and without
               consideration of antidepressant exposure during pregnancy.
               RESULTS: Among 7,267 women, 831 (11\%) screened positive for
               depression. In multivariable analyses adjusting for maternal
               age, race, income, body mass index, tobacco use, lifetime
               diagnosis of major depression and anxiety, diabetes,
               hypertension, and preeclampsia, women who screened positive for
               depression experienced an increased risk of preterm birth (less
               than 37 weeks of gestation) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95\%
               confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.55) and very preterm birth (less

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous
               disorder because of the variable criteria used for diagnosis.
               Therefore, International Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9)
               codes may not accurately capture the diagnostic criteria
               necessary for large scale PCOS identification. We hypothesized
               that use of electronic medical records text and data would more
               specifically capture PCOS subjects. METHODS: Subjects with PCOS
               were identified in the Partners Healthcare Research Patients
               Data Registry by searching for the term ``polycystic ovary
               syndrome'' using natural language processing (n = 24,930). A
               training subset of 199 identified charts was reviewed and
               categorized based on likelihood of a true Rotterdam PCOS
               diagnosis, i.e. two out of three of the following: irregular
               menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism and/or polycystic ovary
               morphology. Data from the history, physical exam, laboratory and
               radiology results were codified and extracted from notes of
               definite PCOS subjects. Thirty-two terms were used to build an
               algorithm for identifying definite PCOS cases and applied to the
               rest of the dataset. The positive predictive value cutoff was
               set at 76.8 \% to maximize the number of subjects available for
               study. A true positive predictive value for the algorithm was
               calculated after review of 100 charts from subjects identified
               as definite PCOS cases with at least two documented Rotterdam
               criteria. The positive predictive value was compared to that
               calculated using 200 charts identified using the ICD-9 code for
               PCOS (256.4; n = 13,670). In addition, a cohort of previously
               recruited PCOS subjects was submitted for algorithm validation.
               RESULTS: Chart review demonstrated that 64 \% were confirmed as
               definitely PCOS using the algorithm, with a 9 \% false positive
               rate. 66 \% of subjects identified by ICD-9 code for PCOS could
               be confirmed as definitely PCOS, with an 8.5 \% false positive
               rate. There was no significant difference in the positive
               predictive values using the two methods (p = 0.2). However, the
               number of charts that had insufficient confirmatory data was
               lower using the algorithm (5 \% vs 11 \%; p < 0.04). Of 477
               subjects with PCOS recruited and examined individually and
               present in the database as patients, 451 were found within the
               algorithm dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of text parameters
               along with codified data improves the confidence in PCOS patient
               cohorts identified using the electronic medical record. However,
               the positive predictive value was not significantly different
               when using ICD-9 codes or the specific algorithm. Further
               studies are needed to determine the positive predictive value of
               the two methods in additional electronic medical record

               review was conducted of children aged 5 to 18 years in the
               Partners Healthcare system with at least 1 prescription of an
               antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August
               2011. The authors extracted lifetime diagnoses and QTc interval
               of patients who had received an electrocardiogram 14 to 90 days
               after antidepressant or methadone prescription (N = 297). The
               mean QTc per medication was calculated as compared with the mean
               of all QTc measurements across medications. The number of
               patients taking medications who had QTc values in normal,
               borderline, abnormal, or high were also calculated. RESULTS:
               Mean QTc values for all medications were in the normal range.
               The highest mean QTc was in patients on escitalopram (436
               milliseconds). The mean QTc for sertraline (416 milliseconds)
               was significantly lower than all other drugs measured (t(331) =
               -2.21, p < .05). After controlling for confounding effects, none
               of the differences in mean QTc compared with other study drugs
               reached statistical significance. The greatest percentages of
               abnormal and high QTc values were found among patients taking
               paroxetine (18.8\%), followed by escitalopram (15.4\%). None of
               the children had documented ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION:

               studies may be reduced by creating effective methods for finding
               adequate controls. We implemented a method to match case and
               control populations to compensate for sparse and unequal data
               collection practices common in EHR data. We did this by matching
               the healthcare utilization of patients after observing that more
               complete data was collected on high healthcare utilization
               patients vs. low healthcare utilization patients. In our
               results, we show that many of the anomalous differences in
               population comparisons are mitigated using this matching method

               an example, the comparison of the disease associations of

               discharge, 1635 (6.3\%) within 180 days of discharge, 2360
               (9.1\%) within one year, and 3465 (13.4\%) within two years.
               Older age, female sex, white or African-American race, public
               insurance, greater number of drugs taken on discharge, and score
               for burden of adverse effects were each independently associated
               with hazard for fall. For drug burden, presence of a drug with a
               frequency of adverse effects related to fall of 10\% was
               associated with 3.5\% increase in odds of falling over the next
               two years (odds ratio 1.04, 95\% confidence interval 1.02 to
               1.05). In an independent testing set, the area under the
               receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.65 for a fall
               within two years based on cross sectional data and 0.72 with the
               addition of prior utilization data including age adjusted
               Charlson comorbidity index. Portability was promising, with area
               under the curve of 0.71 for the longitudinal model in a second
               hospital system. CONCLUSIONS: It is potentially useful to
               stratify risk of falls based on clinical features available as
               artifacts of routine clinical care. A web based tool can be used
               to calculate and visualize risk associated with drug treatment

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMR) provide a unique
               opportunity for efficient, large-scale clinical investigation in
               psychiatry. However, such studies will require development of
               tools to define treatment outcome. METHOD: Natural language
               processing (NLP) was applied to classify notes from 127 504
               patients with a billing diagnosis of major depressive disorder,
               drawn from out-patient psychiatry practices affiliated with
               multiple, large New England hospitals. Classifications were
               compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and
               to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of
               senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were
               then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were
               compared with a clinician-rated gold standard. RESULTS: Models
               incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data
               alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver
               operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55). When
               these cross-sectional visits were integrated to define
               longitudinal outcomes and incorporate treatment data, 15\% of
               the cohort remitted with a single antidepressant treatment,
               while 13\% were identified as failing to remit despite at least
               two antidepressant trials. Non-remitting patients were more
               likely to be non-Caucasian (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The
               application of bioinformatics tools such as NLP should enable
               accurate and efficient determination of longitudinal outcomes,
               enabling existing EMR data to be applied to clinical research,
               including biomarker investigations. Continued development will
               be required to better address moderators of outcome such as
               adherence and co-morbidity.",

               rupture. However, large-scale assessments of morphological
               parameters correlated with intracranial aneurysm rupture in a
               location-specific manner are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
               the morphological characteristics associated with ruptured
               middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. METHODS: Five hundred
               sixty-one patients with 638 MCA aneurysms diagnosed between 1990
               and 2016 who had available computed tomography angiography (CTA)
               were included in this study. CTAs were evaluated using the
               Vitrea Advanced Visualization software for 3-dimensional (3D)
               reconstruction. Morphological parameters examined in each model
               included aneurysm projection, wall irregularity, presence of a
               daughter dome, presence of hypoplastic or aplastic A1 arteries
               and hypoplastic or fetal posterior communicating arteries
               (PCoA), aneurysm height and width, neck diameter, bottleneck
               factor, aspect and size ratio, height/width ratio, and diameters
               and angles of surrounding parent and daughter vessels.
               Univariable and multivariable statistical analyses were
               performed to determine the association of morphological
               characteristics with rupture of MCA aneurysms. Logistic
               regression was used to build a predictive MCA score. RESULTS:
               Greater bottleneck and size ratio, and irregular, multilobed,
               temporally projecting MCA aneurysms are associated with higher
               rupture risk, whereas higher M1/M2 ratio, larger width, and the
               presence of an ipsilateral or bilateral hypoplastic PCoA were
               inversely associated with rupture. The MCA score had good
               predictive capacity with area under the receiver operating curve
               = 0.88. CONCLUSION: These practical morphological parameters
               specific to MCA aneurysms are easy to assess when examining 3D
               reconstructions of unruptured aneurysms and could aid in risk

              disorder (MDD) have met with limited success. We sought to
              increase statistical power to detect disease loci by conducting a
              GWAS mega-analysis for MDD. In the MDD discovery phase, we
              analyzed more than 1.2 million autosomal and X chromosome
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 759 independent and
              unrelated subjects of recent European ancestry (9240 MDD cases
              and 9519 controls). In the MDD replication phase, we evaluated
              554 SNPs in independent samples (6783 MDD cases and 50 695
              controls). We also conducted a cross-disorder meta-analysis using
              819 autosomal SNPs with P<0.0001 for either MDD or the
              Psychiatric GWAS Consortium bipolar disorder (BIP) mega-analysis
              (9238 MDD cases/8039 controls and 6998 BIP cases/7775 controls).
              No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the MDD discovery
              phase, the MDD replication phase or in pre-planned secondary
              analyses (by sex, recurrent MDD, recurrent early-onset MDD, age
              of onset, pre-pubertal onset MDD or typical-like MDD from a
              latent class analyses of the MDD criteria). In the MDD-bipolar
              cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide
              significance (P<5 $\times$ 10(-8)), and all were in a 248 kb
              interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52 425 083-53 822 102,
              minimum P=5.9 $\times$ 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the
              largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high
              prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect
              genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were
              unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss
              what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP
              finding should be interpreted with caution as the most
              significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping
              in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status.",

              without ASD or ADHD. All children were linked with maternal
              health data using birth certificates and EHRs to determine
              prenatal medication exposures. Multiple logistic regression was
              used to examine association between prenatal antidepressant
              exposures and ASD or ADHD risk. A total of 1377 children
              diagnosed with ASD and 2243 with ADHD were matched with healthy
              controls. In models adjusted for sociodemographic features,
              antidepressant exposure prior to and during pregnancy was
              associated with ASD risk, but risk associated with exposure
              during pregnancy was no longer significant after controlling for
              maternal major depression (odds ratio (OR) 1.10 (0.70-1.70)).
              Conversely, antidepressant exposure during but not prior to
              pregnancy was associated with ADHD risk, even after adjustment
              for maternal depression (OR 1.81 (1.22-2.70)). These results
              suggest that the risk of autism observed with prenatal
              antidepressant exposure is likely confounded by severity of
              maternal illness, but further indicate that such exposure may
              still be associated with ADHD risk. This risk, modest in absolute
              terms, may still be a result of residual confounding and must be
              balanced against the substantial consequences of untreated
              maternal depression.",

               SLE, algorithms are needed to accurately identify these
               patients. We used machine learning to generate data-driven SLE
               EHR algorithms and assessed performance of existing rule-based
               algorithms. METHODS: We randomly selected subjects with $\geq$ 1
               SLE ICD-9/10 codes from our EHR and identified gold standard
               definite and probable SLE cases by chart review, based on 1997
               ACR or 2012 SLICC Classification Criteria. From a training set,
               we extracted coded and narrative concepts using natural language
               processing and generated algorithms using penalized logistic
               regression to classify definite or definite/probable SLE. We
               assessed predictive characteristics in internal and external
               cohort validations. We also tested performance characteristics
               of published rule-based algorithms with pre-specified
               permutations of ICD-9 codes, laboratory tests and medications in
               our EHR. RESULTS: At a specificity of 97\%, our machine learning
               coded algorithm for definite SLE had 90\% positive predictive
               value (PPV) and 64\% sensitivity and for definite/probable SLE,
               92\% PPV and 47\% sensitivity. In the external validation, at
               97\% specificity, the definite/probable algorithm had 94\% PPV
               and 60\% sensitivity. Adding NLP concepts did not improve
               performance metrics. The PPVs of published rule-based algorithms
               ranged from 45-79\% in our EHR. CONCLUSION: Our machine learning
               SLE algorithms performed well in internal and external

               by episodes of mania and depression. Although genomewide
               association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic
               loci contributing to BD risk, sample size has become a
               rate-limiting obstacle to genetic discovery. Electronic health
               records (EHRs) represent a vast but relatively untapped resource
               for high-throughput phenotyping. As part of the International
               Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD), we previously
               validated automated EHR-based phenotyping algorithms for BD
               against in-person diagnostic interviews (Castro et al. Am J
               Psychiatry 172:363-372, 2015). Here, we establish the genetic
               validity of these phenotypes by determining their genetic
               correlation with traditionally ascertained samples. Case and
               control algorithms were derived from structured and narrative
               text in the Partners Healthcare system comprising more than 4.6
               million patients over 20 years. Genomewide genotype data for
               3330 BD cases and 3952 controls of European ancestry were used
               to estimate SNP-based heritability (h2g) and genetic correlation
               (rg) between EHR-based phenotype definitions and traditionally
               ascertained BD cases in GWAS by the ICCBD and Psychiatric
               Genomics Consortium (PGC) using LD score regression. We
               evaluated BD cases identified using 4 EHR-based algorithms: an
               NLP-based algorithm (95-NLP) and three rule-based algorithms
               using codified EHR with decreasing levels of
               stringency-``coded-strict'', ``coded-broad'', and ``coded-broad
               based on a single clinical encounter'' (coded-broad-SV). The
               analytic sample comprised 862 95-NLP, 1968 coded-strict, 2581
               coded-broad, 408 coded-broad-SV BD cases, and 3 952 controls.
               The estimated h2g were 0.24 (p = 0.015), 0.09 (p = 0.064), 0.13
               (p = 0.003), 0.00 (p = 0.591) for 95-NLP, coded-strict,
               coded-broad and coded-broad-SV BD, respectively. The h2g for all
               EHR-based cases combined except coded-broad-SV (excluded due to
               0 h2g) was 0.12 (p = 0.004). These h2g were lower or similar to
               the h2g observed by the ICCBD + PGCBD (0.23, p = 3.17E-80, total
               N = 33,181). However, the rg between ICCBD + PGCBD and the
               EHR-based cases were high for 95-NLP (0.66, p = 3.69 $\times$
               10-5), coded-strict (1.00, p = 2.40 $\times$ 10-4), and
               coded-broad (0.74, p = 8.11 $\times$ 10-7). The rg between
               EHR-based BD definitions ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. These results
               provide the first genetic validation of automated EHR-based
               phenotyping for BD and suggest that this approach identifies
               cases that are highly genetically correlated with those
               ascertained through conventional methods. High throughput
               phenotyping using the large data resources available in EHRs

               illness obscures the complexity of these disorders. Capturing
               multiple dimensional measures of neuropathology could facilitate
               the clinical and neurobiological investigation of cognitive and
               behavioral phenotypes. METHODS: We developed a natural language
               processing-based approach to extract five symptom dimensions,
               based on the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain
               Criteria definitions, from narrative clinical notes. Estimates
               of Research Domain Criteria loading were derived from a cohort
               of 3619 individuals with 4623 hospital admissions. We applied
               this tool to a large corpus of psychiatric inpatient admission
               and discharge notes (2010-2015), and using the same cohort we
               examined face validity, predictive validity, and convergent
               validity with gold standard annotations. RESULTS: In
               mixed-effect models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical
               features, greater negative and positive symptom domains were
               associated with a shorter length of stay ($\beta$ = -.88, p =
               .001 and $\beta$ = -1.22, p < .001, respectively), while greater
               social and arousal domain scores were associated with a longer
               length of stay ($\beta$ = .93, p < .001 and $\beta$ = .81, p =
               .007, respectively). In fully adjusted Cox regression models, a
               greater positive domain score at discharge was also associated
               with a significant increase in readmission risk (hazard ratio =
               1.22, p < .001). Positive and negative valence domains were
               correlated with expert annotation (by analysis of variance [df =
               3], R2 = .13 and .19, respectively). Likewise, in a subset of
               patients, neurocognitive testing was correlated with cognitive
               performance scores (p < .008 for three of six measures).
               CONCLUSIONS: This shows that natural language processing can be
               used to efficiently and transparently score clinical notes in

              One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the
              ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a
              cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through
              glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate
              that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements

              in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase
              risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders.
              Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate
              amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype
              and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network
              modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic
              differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate
              the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by

               approach for constructing temporal representations from EHR
               observations for downstream machine learning. Using clinical
               data from a cohort of patients with congestive heart failure, we
               mined temporal representations by transitive sequencing of EHR
               medication and diagnosis records for classification and
               prediction tasks. We compared the classification and prediction
               performances of the transitive sequential representations

               using aggregated vectors of EHR data (aggregated vector

               transitive sequential representations are better phenotype
               ``differentiators'' and predictors than the ``atemporal'' EHR
               records. Our results also demonstrated that data representations

               present novel insights about the progression of the disease that

              placed unprecedented stress on health systems across the world,
              and reliable estimates of risk for adverse hospital outcomes are
              needed. Objective: To quantify admission laboratory and
              comorbidity features associated with critical illness and
              mortality risk across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design,
              Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of all
              individuals admitted to the hospital who tested positive for
              severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by
              polymerase chain reaction across these 6 hospitals through June
              5, 2020, using hospital course, prior diagnoses, and laboratory
              values in emergency department and inpatient settings from 2
              academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. The data were
              extracted on June 11, 2020, and the analysis was conducted from
              June to July 2020. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: Severe illness defined by admission to intensive care
              unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 2511
              hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of
              whom 50.9\% were male, 53.9\% White, and 27.0\% Hispanic, with a
              mean [SD ]age of 62.6 [19.0] years), 215 (8.6\%) were admitted to
              the intensive care unit, 164 (6.5\%) required mechanical
              ventilation, and 292 (11.6\%) died. L1-regression models
              developed in 3 of these hospitals yielded an area under the
              receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.807 for severe
              illness and 0.847 for mortality in the 3 held-out hospitals. In
              total, 212 of 292 deaths (72.6\%) occurred in the highest-risk
              mortality quintile. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort,
              specific admission laboratory studies in concert with

              COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) is an international collaboration
              addressing COVID-19 with federated analyses of electronic health
              record (EHR) data. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and validate a
              computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Twelve 4CE
              sites participated. First we developed an EHR-based severity
              phenotype consisting of six code classes, and we validated it on
              patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites
              against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also
              piloted an alternative machine-learning approach and compared
              selected predictors of severity to the 4CE phenotype at one site.
              RESULTS: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity
              of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU
              admission and/or death. The sensitivity of individual code
              categories for acuity had high variability - up to 0.65 across
              sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean
              AUC 0.903 (95\% CI: 0.886, 0.921), compared to AUC 0.956 (95\%
              CI: 0.952, 0.959) for the machine-learning approach. Billing
              codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with as low as 49\%
              precision and recall compared to chart review. DISCUSSION: We
              developed a severity phenotype using 6 code classes that proved
              resilient to coding variability across international
              institutions. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may
              overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed
              discrepancies even in the gold-standard outcomes, possibly due to
              heterogeneous pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: We developed an
              EHR-based severity phenotype for COVID-19 in hospitalized
              patients and validated it at 12 international sites.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A major bottleneck hindering utilization of electronic
              health record data for translational research is the lack of
              precise phenotype labels. Chart review as well as rule-based and
              supervised phenotyping approaches require laborious expert input,
              hampering applicability to studies that require many phenotypes
              to be defined and labeled de novo. Though International
              Classification of Diseases codes are often used as surrogates for
              true labels in this setting, these sometimes suffer from poor
              specificity. We propose a fully automated topic modeling
              algorithm to simultaneously annotate multiple phenotypes.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surrogate-guided ensemble latent Dirichlet
              allocation (sureLDA) is a label-free multidimensional phenotyping
              method. It first uses the PheNorm algorithm to initialize
              probabilities based on 2 surrogate features for each target
              phenotype, and then leverages these probabilities to constrain
              the LDA topic model to generate phenotype-specific topics.
              Finally, it combines phenotype-feature counts with surrogates via
              clustering ensemble to yield final phenotype probabilities.
              RESULTS: sureLDA achieves reliably high accuracy and precision
              across a range of simulated and real-world phenotypes. Its
              performance is robust to phenotype prevalence and relative
              informativeness of surogate vs nonsurrogate features. It also
              exhibits powerful feature selection properties. DISCUSSION:
              sureLDA combines attractive properties of PheNorm and LDA to
              achieve high accuracy and precision robust to diverse phenotype
              characteristics. It offers particular improvement for phenotypes
              insufficiently captured by a few surrogate features. Moreover,
              sureLDA's feature selection ability enables it to handle high
              feature dimensions and produce interpretable computational
              phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: sureLDA is well suited toward
              large-scale electronic health record phenotyping for highly
              multiphenotype applications such as phenome-wide association
              studies .",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic stress, conditioned by the morphology of
              the surrounding vasculature, plays an important role in aneurysm
              formation. Our goal was to identify image-based location-specific
              parameters that are associated with posterior communicating
              artery (PCoA) aneurysms. METHODS: Three-dimensional morphological
              parameters obtained from CT angiography or digital subtraction
              angiography from 187 patients with unilateral PCoA aneurysms,
              diagnosed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts
              General Hospital between 1990 and 2016, were evaluated. In order
              to control for genetic and clinical risk factors, we chose the
              contralateral unaffected PCoA as a control group. We examined
              diameters and angles of the surrounding parent and daughter
              vessels. Univariable and multivariable statistical analyses were
              performed to determine statistical significance. Sensitivity
              analyses with small aneurysms ($\leq$5 mm) only and an unmatched
              analysis of 432 PCoA aneurysms and 197 control patients without
              PCoA aneurysms were also performed. RESULTS: In a multivariable
              conditional logistic regression model we showed that smaller
              diameter size ratio (OR 1.45$\times$10-5, 95\% CI
              1.12$\times$10-7 to 1.88$\times$10-3) and larger
              daughter-daughter angle (OR 1.04, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.07) were
              significantly associated with PCoA aneurysm presence after
              correcting for other variables. In subgroup analyses of small
              aneurysms ($\leq$5 mm) and in an unmatched analysis the
              significance and direction of these results were preserved.
              CONCLUSIONS: Larger daughter-daughter angles and smaller diameter
              size ratio are significantly associated with the presence of PCoA
              aneurysms. These simple parameters can be utilized to guide the

              (EHRs) of 2,286 patients who received a chromosomal microarray
              test, and 9,144 matched controls, to build a model to predict who

              accuracies in a held-out test sample (area under the receiver

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a common condition associated with
              increased morbidity and mortality. Medication side effects are a
              possible source of modifiable delirium risk and provide an
              opportunity to improve delirium predictive models. This study
              characterized the risk for delirium diagnosis by applying a
              previously validated algorithm for calculating central nervous
              system adverse effect burden arising from a full medication list.
              METHOD: Using a cohort of hospitalized adult (age 18-65) patients
              from the Massachusetts All-Payers Claims Database, we calculated
              medication burden following hospital discharge and characterized
              risk of new coded delirium diagnosis over the following 90 days.
              We applied the resulting model to a held-out test cohort.
              RESULTS: The cohort included 62,180 individuals of whom 1.6\%
              (1019) went on to have a coded delirium diagnosis. In the
              training cohort (43,527 individuals), the medication burden
              feature was positively associated with delirium diagnosis (OR =
              5.75, 95\% CI 4.34-7.63) and this association persisted (aOR =
              1.95; 1.31-2.92) after adjusting for demographics, clinical
              features, prescribed medications, and anticholinergic risk score.
              In the test cohort, the trained model produced an area under the
              curve of 0.80 (0.78-0.82). This performance was similar across
              subgroups of age and gender. CONCLUSION: Aggregating
              brain-related medication adverse effects facilitates

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death
              worldwide, yet clinicians find it difficult to reliably identify
              individuals at high risk for suicide. Algorithmic approaches for
              suicide risk detection have been developed in recent years,
              mostly based on data from electronic health records (EHRs).
              Significant room for improvement remains in the way these models
              take advantage of temporal information to improve predictions.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a temporally enhanced variant
              of the random forest (RF) model-Omni-Temporal Balanced Random
              Forests (OT-BRFs)-that incorporates temporal information in every
              tree within the forest. We develop and validate this model using
              longitudinal EHRs and clinician notes from the Mass General
              Brigham Health System recorded between 1998 and 2018, and compare
              its performance to a baseline Naive Bayes Classifier and 2
              standard versions of balanced RFs. RESULTS: Temporal variables
              were found to be associated with suicide risk: Elevated suicide
              risk was observed in individuals with a higher total number of
              visits as well as those with a low rate of visits over time,
              while lower suicide risk was observed in individuals with a
              longer period of EHR coverage. RF models were more accurate than
              Naive Bayesian classifiers at predicting suicide risk in advance
              (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.824 vs. 0.754,
              respectively). The proposed OT-BRF model performed best among all
              RF approaches, yielding a sensitivity of 0.339 at 95\%
              specificity, compared to 0.290 and 0.286 for the other 2 RF
              models. Temporal variables were assigned high importance by the
              models that incorporated them. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that
              temporal variables have an important role to play in suicide risk
              detection and that requiring their inclusion in all RF trees
              leads to increased predictive performance. Integrating temporal
              information into risk prediction models helps the models
              interpret patient data in temporal context, improving predictive
              performance.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Integrating and harmonizing disparate patient data
              sources into one consolidated data portal enables researchers to
              conduct analysis efficiently and effectively. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We describe an implementation of Informatics for
              Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) to create the Mass
              General Brigham (MGB) Biobank Portal data repository. The
              repository integrates data from primary and curated data sources
              and is updated weekly. The data are made readily available to
              investigators in a data portal where they can easily construct
              and export customized datasets for analysis. RESULTS: As of July
              2021, there are 125 645 consented patients enrolled in the MGB
              Biobank. 88 527 (70.5\%) have a biospecimen, 55 121 (43.9\%) have
              completed the health information survey, 43 552 (34.7\%) have
              genomic data and 124 760 (99.3\%) have EHR data. Twenty machine
              learning computed phenotypes are calculated on a weekly basis.
              There are currently 1220 active investigators who have run 58 793
              patient queries and exported 10 257 analysis files. DISCUSSION:
              The Biobank Portal allows noninformatics researchers to conduct
              study feasibility by querying across many data sources and then
              extract data that are most useful to them for clinical studies.
              While institutions require substantial informatics resources to
              establish and maintain integrated data repositories, they yield
              significant research value to a wide range of investigators.
              CONCLUSION: The Biobank Portal and other patient data portals
              that integrate complex and simple datasets enable diverse
              research use cases. i2b2 tools to implement these registries and
              make the data interoperable are open source and freely available.",

              systems has created enormous potential for translational
              research. However, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes
              related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes
              available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the
              use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share
              data across institutions. In this project, we demonstrate that
              multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to
              efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease of
              interest. We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide
              range of codified concepts from EHRs from two large medical
              centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding
              regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network
              analysis. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and
              assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight
              diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge
              map combining embedding data from both institutions. The features
              selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of
              codified data generated by domain experts. Features identified
              via KESER resulted in comparable performance to those built upon
              features selected manually or with patient-level data. The
              knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified
              disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared
              to those identified using single institution data. Analysis of
              code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical
              knowledge and infer relatedness among codified concepts. KESER
              bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses
              providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies

               records (EHRs) are becoming increasingly widespread in clinical
               practice. With suicide-related mortality rates rising in recent
               years, it is becoming increasingly urgent to understand,
               predict, and prevent suicidal behavior. Here, we compare the
               predictive value of structured and unstructured EHR data for
               predicting suicide risk. We find that Naive Bayes Classifier
               (NBC) and Random Forest (RF) models trained on structured EHR
               data perform better than those based on unstructured EHR data.
               An NBC model trained on both structured and unstructured data
               yields similar performance (AUC = 0.743) to an NBC model trained
               on structured data alone (0.742, p = 0.668), while an RF model
               trained on both data types yields significantly better results
               (AUC = 0.903) than an RF model trained on structured data alone
               (0.887, p < 0.001), likely due to the RF model's ability to
               capture interactions between the two data types. To investigate
               these interactions, we propose and implement a general framework
               for identifying specific structured-unstructured feature pairs
               whose interactions differ between case and non-case cohorts, and
               thus have the potential to improve predictive performance and
               increase understanding of clinical risk. We find that such
               feature pairs tend to capture heterogeneous pairs of general
               concepts, rather than homogeneous pairs of specific concepts.
               These findings and this framework can be used to improve current

              suicide attempts within 1 and 6 months of presentation at an
              emergency department (ED) for psychiatric problems. Design,
              Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study assessed the
              1-month and 6-month risk of suicide attempts among 1818 patients
              presenting to an ED between February 4, 2015, and March 13, 2017,
              with psychiatric problems. Data analysis was performed from May
              1, 2020, to November 19, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              Suicide attempts 1 and 6 months after presentation to the ED were
              defined by combining data from electronic health records (EHRs)
              with patient 1-month (n = 1102) and 6-month (n = 1220) follow-up
              surveys. Ensemble machine learning was used to develop predictive
              models and a risk score for suicide. Results: A total of 1818
              patients participated in this study (1016 men [55.9\%]; median
              age, 33 years [IQR, 24-46 years]; 266 Hispanic patients [14.6\%];
              1221 non-Hispanic White patients [67.2\%], 142 non-Hispanic Black
              patients [7.8\%], 64 non-Hispanic Asian patients [3.5\%], and 125
              non-Hispanic patients of other race and ethnicity [6.9\%]). A
              total of 137 of 1102 patients (12.9\%; weighted prevalence)
              attempted suicide within 1 month, and a total of 268 of 1220
              patients (22.0\%; weighted prevalence) attempted suicide within 6
              months. Clinicians' assessment alone was little better than
              chance at predicting suicide attempts, with externally validated
              area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
              0.67 for the 1-month model and 0.60 for the 6-month model.
              Prediction accuracy was slightly higher for models based on EHR
              data (1-month model: AUC, 0.71; 6 month model: AUC, 0.65) and was
              best using patient self-reports (1-month model: AUC, 0.76;
              6-month model: AUC, 0.77), especially when patient self-reports
              were combined with EHR and/or clinician data (1-month model: AUC,
              0.77; and 6 month model: AUC, 0.79). A model that used only 20
              patient self-report questions and an EHR-based risk score
              performed similarly well (1-month model: AUC, 0.77; 6 month
              model: AUC, 0.78). In the best 1-month model, 30.7\% (positive
              predicted value) of the patients classified as having highest
              risk (top 25\% of the sample) made a suicide attempt within 1
              month of their ED visit, accounting for 64.8\% (sensitivity) of
              all 1-month attempts. In the best 6-month model, 46.0\% (positive
              predicted value) of the patients classified at highest risk made
              a suicide attempt within 6 months of their ED visit, accounting
              for 50.2\% (sensitivity) of all 6-month attempts. Conclusions and
              Relevance: This prognostic study suggests that the ability to
              identify patients at high risk of suicide attempt after an ED
              visit for psychiatric problems improved using a combination of
              patient self-reports and EHR data.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Interest in developing machine learning models that
              use electronic health record data to predict patients' risk of
              suicidal behavior has recently proliferated. However, whether and
              how such models might be implemented and useful in clinical
              practice remain unknown. To ultimately make automated suicide
              risk-prediction models useful in practice, and thus better
              prevent patient suicides, it is critical to partner with key
              stakeholders, including the frontline providers who will be using
              such tools, at each stage of the implementation process.
              OBJECTIVE: The aim of this focus group study is to inform ongoing
              and future efforts to deploy suicide risk-prediction models in
              clinical practice. The specific goals are to better understand
              hospital providers' current practices for assessing and managing
              suicide risk; determine providers' perspectives on using
              automated suicide risk-prediction models in practice; and
              identify barriers, facilitators, recommendations, and factors to
              consider. METHODS: We conducted 10 two-hour focus groups with a
              total of 40 providers from psychiatry, internal medicine and
              primary care, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology
              departments within an urban academic medical center. Audio
              recordings of open-ended group discussions were transcribed and
              coded for relevant and recurrent themes by 2 independent study
              staff members. All coded text was reviewed and discrepancies were
              resolved in consensus meetings with doctoral-level staff.
              RESULTS: Although most providers reported using standardized
              suicide risk assessment tools in their clinical practices,
              existing tools were commonly described as unhelpful and providers
              indicated dissatisfaction with current suicide risk assessment
              methods. Overall, providers' general attitudes toward the
              practical use of automated suicide risk-prediction models and
              corresponding clinical decision support tools were positive.
              Providers were especially interested in the potential to identify
              high-risk patients who might be missed by traditional screening
              methods. Some expressed skepticism about the potential usefulness
              of these models in routine care; specific barriers included
              concerns about liability, alert fatigue, and increased demand on
              the health care system. Key facilitators included presenting
              specific patient-level features contributing to risk scores,
              emphasizing changes in risk over time, and developing systematic
              clinical workflows and provider training. Participants also
              recommended considering risk-prediction windows, timing of
              alerts, who will have access to model predictions, and
              variability across treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS: Providers
              were dissatisfied with current suicide risk assessment methods
              and were open to the use of a machine learning-based
              risk-prediction system to inform clinical decision-making. They
              also raised multiple concerns about potential barriers to the
              usefulness of this approach and suggested several possible
              facilitators. Future efforts in this area will benefit from
              incorporating systematic qualitative feedback from providers,
              patients, administrators, and payers on the use of these new
              approaches in routine care, especially given the complex,
              sensitive, and unfortunately still stigmatized nature of suicide
              risk.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In response to COVID-19, the informatics community
              united to aggregate as much clinical data as possible to
              characterize this new disease and reduce its impact through
              collaborative analytics. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative
              (N3C) is now the largest publicly available HIPAA limited dataset
              in US history with over 6.4 million patients and is a testament
              to a partnership of over 100 organizations. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We developed a pipeline for ingesting, harmonizing, and
              centralizing data from 56 contributing data partners using 4
              federated Common Data Models. N3C data quality (DQ) review
              involves both automated and manual procedures. In the process,
              several DQ heuristics were discovered in our centralized context,
              both within the pipeline and during downstream project-based
              analysis. Feedback to the sites led to many local and centralized
              DQ improvements. RESULTS: Beyond well-recognized DQ findings, we
              discovered 15 heuristics relating to source Common Data Model
              conformance, demographics, COVID tests, conditions, encounters,
              measurements, observations, coding completeness, and fitness for
              use. Of 56 sites, 37 sites (66\%) demonstrated issues through
              these heuristics. These 37 sites demonstrated improvement after
              receiving feedback. DISCUSSION: We encountered site-to-site
              differences in DQ which would have been challenging to discover
              using federated checks alone. We have demonstrated that
              centralized DQ benchmarking reveals unique opportunities for DQ
              improvement that will support improved research analytics locally
              and in aggregate. CONCLUSION: By combining rapid, continual
              assessment of DQ with a large volume of multisite data, it is
              possible to support more nuanced scientific questions with the
              scale and rigor that they require.",

              models and clinical studies suggests the protective effect of
              statin use against rupture of intracranial aneurysms; however,
              results from large studies detailing the relationship between
              intracranial aneurysm rupture and total cholesterol, HDL
              (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and
              lipid-lowering agent use are lacking. METHODS: The medical
              records of 4701 patients with 6411 intracranial aneurysms
              diagnosed at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham
              and Women's Hospital between 1990 and 2016 were reviewed and
              analyzed. Patients were separated into ruptured and nonruptured
              groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression
              analyses were performed to determine the effects of lipids (total
              cholesterol, LDL, and HDL) and lipid-lowering medications on
              intracranial aneurysm rupture risk. Propensity score weighting
              was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics
              of the cohorts. RESULTS: Lipid-lowering agent use was
              significantly inversely associated with rupture status (odds
              ratio, 0.58; 95\% confidence interval, 0.47-0.71). In a subgroup
              analysis of complete cases that includes both lipid-lowering
              agent use and lipid values, higher HDL levels (odds ratio, 0.95;
              95\% confidence interval, 0.93-0.98) and lipid-lowering agent use
              (odds ratio, 0.41; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23-0.73) were both
              significantly and inversely associated with rupture status,
              whereas total cholesterol and LDL levels were not significant. A
              monotonic exposure-response curve between HDL levels and risk of
              aneurysmal rupture was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Higher HDL values

               between prior mood disorder diagnosis and hospital outcomes
               among individuals admitted with COVID-19 to six Eastern
               Massachusetts hospitals. METHODS: A retrospective cohort was
               drawn from the electronic health records of two academic medical
               centers and four community hospitals between February 15 and May
               24, 2020. Associations between history of mood disorder and
               in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge home were examined
               using regression models among any hospitalized patients with
               positive tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
               2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Among 2,988 admitted individuals, 717
               (24.0\%) had a prior mood disorder diagnosis. In Cox regression
               models adjusted for age, sex, and hospital site, presence of a
               mood disorder prior to admission was associated with greater
               in-hospital mortality risk beyond hospital day 12 (crude hazard

               ratio=1.540, 95\% CI=1.054, 2.250). A mood disorder diagnosis
               was also associated with greater likelihood of discharge to a
               skilled nursing facility or other rehabilitation facility rather
               than home (crude odds ratio=2.035, 95\% CI=1.661, 2.493; fully

               Hospitalized individuals with a history of mood disorder may be
               at risk for greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and are at
               increased risk of need for postacute care. Further studies
               should investigate the mechanism by which these disorders may

              ruptured posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms, as well

              Three-dimensional morphological parameters in 409 patients with
              432 PCoA aneurysms diagnosed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital
              and Massachusetts General Hospital between 1990 and 2016 who had
              available CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography
              (DSA) were evaluated. Morphological parameters examined included
              aneurysm wall irregularity, presence of a daughter dome, presence
              of hypoplastic or aplastic A1 arteries and hypoplastic or fetal
              PCoA, perpendicular height, width, neck diameter, aspect and size

              Irregular, multilobed PCoA aneurysms with larger height/width
              ratios and larger flow angles were associated with ruptured PCoA
              aneurysms, whereas perpendicular height was inversely associated
              with rupture in a multivariable model. Older age was associated
              with lower aspect ratio, with a trend towards lower height/width
              ratio and smaller flow angle, features that are associated with a
              lower rupture risk. Morphological parameters are easy to assess
              and could help in risk stratification in patients with unruptured
              PCoA aneurysms. PCoA aneurysms diagnosed at older age have

              COVID-19 has not been established. We utilized electronic health
              records across 6 hospitals in Massachusetts to characterize
              cohorts of individuals discharged following admission for
              COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2021, and compared them to
              individuals hospitalized for other indications during this

              clinical notes to identify neuropsychiatric symptom domains up to
              150 days following hospitalization, in addition to those
              reflected in diagnostic codes as measured in prior studies. Among
              6619 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 drawn from a total of
              42,961 hospital discharges, the most commonly-documented symptom
              domains between 31 and 90 days after initial positive test were
              fatigue (13.4\%), mood and anxiety symptoms (11.2\%), and
              impaired cognition (8.0\%). In regression models adjusted for
              sociodemographic features and hospital course, none of these were
              significantly more common among COVID-19 patients; indeed, mood
              and anxiety symptoms were less frequent (adjusted OR 0.72 95\% CI
              0.64-0.92). Between 91 and 150 days after positivity, most
              commonly-detected symptoms were fatigue (10.9\%), mood and
              anxiety symptoms (8.2\%), and sleep disruption (6.8\%), with
              impaired cognition in 5.8\%. Frequency was again similar among
              non-COVID-19 post-hospital patients, with mood and anxiety
              symptoms less common (aOR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.52-0.75).
              Propensity-score matched analyses yielded similar results.
              Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms were common up to 150 days
              after initial hospitalization, but occurred at generally similar
              rates among individuals hospitalized for other indications during
              the same period. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 may benefit from

  abstract = "Importance: Epidemiologic studies suggest maternal immune
              activation during pregnancy may be associated with
              neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. Objective: To evaluate
              whether in utero exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with risk
              for neurodevelopmental disorders in the first 12 months after
              birth. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective
              cohort study examined live offspring of all mothers who delivered
              between March and September 2020 at any of 6 Massachusetts
              hospitals across 2 health systems. Statistical analysis was
              performed from October to December 2021. Exposures: Maternal
              SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction
              test during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              Neurodevelopmental disorders determined from International
              Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
              Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes over the first
              12 months of life; sociodemographic and clinical features of
              mothers and offspring; all drawn from the electronic health
              record. Results: The cohort included 7772 live births (7466
              pregnancies, 96\% singleton, 222 births to SARS-CoV-2 positive
              mothers), with mean (SD) maternal age of 32.9 (5.0) years;
              offspring were 9.9\% Asian (772), 8.4\% Black (656), and 69.0\%
              White (5363); 15.1\% (1134) were of Hispanic ethnicity. Preterm
              delivery was more likely among exposed mothers: 14.4\% (32) vs
              8.7\% (654) (P = .003). Maternal SARS-CoV-2 positivity during
              pregnancy was associated with greater rate of neurodevelopmental
              diagnoses in unadjusted models (odds ratio [OR], 2.17 [95\% CI,
              1.24-3.79]; P = .006) as well as those adjusted for race,
              ethnicity, insurance status, offspring sex, maternal age, and
              preterm status (adjusted OR, 1.86 [95\% CI, 1.03-3.36]; P = .04).
              Third-trimester infection was associated with effects of larger
              magnitude (adjusted OR, 2.34 [95\% CI, 1.23-4.44]; P = .01).
              Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study of SARS-CoV-2
              exposure in utero found preliminary evidence that maternal
              SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with neurodevelopmental sequelae in
              some offspring. Prospective studies with longer follow-up
              duration will be required to exclude confounding and confirm
              these associations.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The growing availability of electronic health records
              (EHR) data opens opportunities for integrative analysis of
              multi-institutional EHR to produce generalizable knowledge. A key
              barrier to such integrative analyses is the lack of semantic
              interoperability across different institutions due to coding
              differences. We propose a Multiview Incomplete Knowledge Graph
              Integration (MIKGI) algorithm to integrate information from
              multiple sources with partially overlapping EHR concept codes to
              enable translations between healthcare systems. METHODS: The
              MIKGI algorithm combines knowledge graph information from (i)
              embeddings trained from the co-occurrence patterns of medical
              codes within each EHR system and (ii) semantic embeddings of the
              textual strings of all medical codes obtained from the
              Self-Aligning Pretrained BERT (SAPBERT) algorithm. Due to the
              heterogeneity in the coding across healthcare systems, each EHR
              source provides partial coverage of the available codes. MIKGI
              synthesizes the incomplete knowledge graphs derived from these
              multi-source embeddings by minimizing a spherical loss function
              that combines the pairwise directional similarities of embeddings
              computed from all available sources. MIKGI outputs harmonized
              semantic embedding vectors for all EHR codes, which improves the
              quality of the embeddings and enables direct assessment of both
              similarity and relatedness between any pair of codes from
              multiple healthcare systems. RESULTS: With EHR co-occurrence data
              from Veteran Affairs (VA) healthcare and Mass General Brigham
              (MGB), MIKGI algorithm produces high quality embeddings for a
              variety of downstream tasks including detecting known similar or
              related entity pairs and mapping VA local codes to the relevant
              EHR codes used at MGB. Based on the cosine similarity of the
              MIKGI trained embeddings, the AUC was 0.918 for detecting similar
              entity pairs and 0.809 for detecting related pairs. For
              cross-institutional medical code mapping, the top 1 and top 5
              accuracy were 91.0\% and 97.5\% when mapping medication codes at
              VA to RxNorm medication codes at MGB; 59.1\% and 75.8\% when
              mapping VA local laboratory codes to LOINC hierarchy. When
              trained with 500 labels, the lab code mapping attained top 1 and
              5 accuracy at 77.7\% and 87.9\%. MIKGI also attained best
              performance in selecting VA local lab codes for desired
              laboratory tests and COVID-19 related features for COVID EHR
              studies. Compared to existing methods, MIKGI attained the most
              robust performance with accuracy the highest or near the highest
              across all tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MIKGI algorithm can
              effectively integrate incomplete summary data from biomedical
              text and EHR data to generate harmonized embeddings for EHR codes
              for knowledge graph modeling and cross-institutional translation
              of EHR codes.",

               However, normal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps change
               rapidly in early childhood, making abnormality detection
               difficult. In this article, we explored clinical PACS and
               electronic healthcare records (EHR) to create age-specific ADC
               atlases for clinical radiology reference. Using the EHR and
               three rounds of multiexpert reviews, we found ADC maps from 201
               children 0-6 years of age scanned between 2006 and 2013 who had
               brain MRIs with no reported abnormalities and normal clinical
               evaluations 2+ years later. These images were grouped in 10 age
               bins, densely sampling the first 1 year of life (5 bins,
               including neonates and 4 quarters) and representing the 1-6 year
               age range (an age bin per year). Unbiased group-wise
               registration was used to construct ADC atlases for 10 age bins.
               We used the atlases to quantify (a) cross-sectional normative
               ADC variations; (b) spatiotemporal heterogeneous ADC changes;
               and (c) spatiotemporal heterogeneous volumetric changes. The
               quantified age-specific whole-brain and region-wise ADC values
               were compared to those from age-matched individual subjects in
               our study and in multiple existing independent studies. The
               significance of this study is that we have shown that clinically
               acquired images can be used to construct normative age-specific
               atlases. These first of their kind age-specific normative ADC
               atlases quantitatively characterize changes of
               myelination-related water diffusion in the first 6 years of
               life. The quantified voxel-wise spatiotemporal ADC variations
               provide standard references to assist radiologists toward more
               objective interpretation of abnormalities in clinical images.
